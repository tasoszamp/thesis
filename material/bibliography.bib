abstract = {Context:
Re-architecting monolithic systems with Microservices-based architecture is a common trend. Various companies are migrating to Microservices for different reasons. However, making such an important decision like re-architecting an entire system must be based on real facts and not only on gut feelings.
Objective:
The goal of this work is to propose an evidence-based decision support framework for companies that need to migrate to Microservices, based on the analysis of a set of characteristics and metrics they should collect before re-architecting their monolithic system.
Method:
We conducted a survey done in the form of interviews with professionals to derive the assessment framework based on Grounded Theory.
Results:
We identified a set consisting of information and metrics that companies can use to decide whether to migrate to Microservices or not. The proposed assessment framework, based on the aforementioned metrics, could be useful for companies if they need to migrate to Microservices and do not want to run the risk of failing to consider some important information.}

ABSTRACT = {Currently, organizations face the need to create scalable applications in an agile way that impacts new forms of production and business organization. The traditional monolithic architecture no longer meets the needs of scalability and rapid development. The efficiency and optimization of human and technological resources prevail; this is why companies must adopt new technologies and business strategies. However, the implementation of microservices still encounters several challenges, such as the consumption of time and computational resources, scalability, orchestration, organization problems, and several further technical complications. Although there are procedures that facilitate the migration from a monolithic architecture to micro-services, none of them accurately quantifies performance differences. The current study aims primarily to analyze some related work that evaluated both architectures. Furthermore, we assess the performance and relationship between different variables of an application that runs in a monolithic structure compared to one of the micro-services. With this, the state-of-the-art review was initially conducted, which confirms the interest of the industry. Subsequently, two different scenarios were evaluated: the first one comprises a web application based on a monolithic architecture that operates on a virtual server with KVM, and the second one demonstrates the same web application based on a microservice architecture, but it runs in containers. Both situations were exposed to stress tests of similar characteristics and with the same hardware resources. For their validation, we applied the non-parametric regression mathematical model to explain the dependency relationship between the performance variables. The results provided a quantitative technical interpretation with precision and reliability, which can be applied to similar issues.},

ABSTRACT = {The development was carried out using the Qt5.2 integrated development environment, which uses the programming language C++. The main advantage of this environment is that the code written in it can be compiled to different platforms (for example, Windows, Linux, Mac OS). A software router based on a modular architecture has been developed. It uses the socket technology, which allows forming a program-oriented packet network with any topology, including full-coupled topology. A network traffic generator to test the developed software router has been designed. We proposed a scheme to measure the packet processing time of a router using a specialized packet-capture network interface cards (NIC 1 and NIC 2) and a novel traffic generator installed on PC. Based on an experimental test bed we confirmed that our software router provides a cost-efficient alternative to the expensive, special hardware router CISCO 2801.},

abstract = {Network traffic workloads are widely utilized in applied research to verify correctness and to measure the impact of novel algorithms, protocols, and network functions. We provide a comprehensive survey of traffic generators referenced by researchers over the last 13 years, providing in-depth classification of the functional behaviors of the most frequently cited generators. These classifications are then used as a critical component of a methodology presented to aid in the selection of generators derived from the workload requirements of future research.},
