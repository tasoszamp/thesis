I would like to thank, first and foremost, Christos Tranoris, Researcher at the NAM group, who guided me at every step of the thesis, put up with incoherent messages and ideas during the most improper hours. I have the privilege to call him a mentor, a colleague a and a friend. I would also like to thank Professor Spiros Denazis for introducing me to the NAM group and for his insightful comments on this work. Most importantly, I want to thank John Gialelis who introduced me to the  world of Academic Research and who has been my mentor for over 2 years. Finally, I want to thank the whole team of NAM group for the fruitful conversations, as also the online communities and developers of the projects: \textit{EdgeX Foundry}, \textit{Filecoin}, \textit{loraserver.io}, \textit{Node-RED} and \textit{balena}, for their continuing assistance and guidance throughout the implementation. I dedicate this work to my Parents, \textit{Despoina} and \textit{George}, who laid the foundations for everything I have accomplished thus far, and to my friends and my companion, who have supported me, put up with me and pushed me to become a better human being.
